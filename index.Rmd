#### In progress..
* This video will be for a page on this site
* I made the video public on vimeo to play around with adding it
* I assumed nobody would watch it until the site was ready
* Then I realized somebody might actually watch it
* If so, then somebody might want the stuff I mentioned
* Well, I don't have the all the pages ready yet (sorry about that)
* But I do have the steps below, which are the important parts
* Sorry again, the rest will be here soon...
