## Leaflet
* Try [Leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet) for Interactive Maps
* Pretty easy to add to your site with just a few lines
* In Baltimore we love our [Trash Wheels!](http://baltimorewaterfront.com/healthy-harbor/water-wheel)

```{r}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-76.603611, lat=39.283167, popup="Mr. Trash Wheel Cleans Here!") %>%
  addMarkers(lng=-76.580603, lat=39.279603, popup="Professor Trash Wheel Cleans Here!")
